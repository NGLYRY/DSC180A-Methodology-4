1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter has been the research into what may be the most important words to give to someone, so they can understand a passage.
2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
I want to investigate ways to improve audio media without the need for people to be actively invested in it. As that is the main appeal for many listeners. 
3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
I want to figure out a way to make audio media features that make it more engaging and intuitive without forcing people to constantly interacting with the media in a somewhat repetitive manner (spinning a finger clockwise continously)
4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
I would be interested in incorperating aspects of the brain eeg scans and see what kinds of things get people's attentions from audio media.
